## Documentation Workflow

TextCollector follows a documentation-driven development approach:

1. **Specification Phase**
   - Create feature specifications in `/specifications`
   - Document architectural decisions in `/architecture/adr`
   - Define requirements and acceptance criteria

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Develop implementation plans in `/planning` 
   - Break down features into actionable tasks
   - Establish timelines and priorities

3. **Development Phase**
   - Reference specifications during implementation
   - Update API documentation as code evolves
   - Document developer guides for new components

4. **Release Phase**
   - Finalize user documentation in `/guides/user`
   - Update README and quick-start guides
   - Document any changes to APIs or behaviors

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating documentation:

1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Use Markdown formatting consistently
3. Link related documents where appropriate
4. Keep API documentation synchronized with code changes
5. Update the relevant README files when adding new documents

## Converting Documentation to Tasks

To facilitate product development flow:

1. Specifications can be converted to GitHub issues
2. Implementation plans can be broken down into milestones
3. Architecture decisions provide context for technical approaches
4. User guides inform testing and validation criteria
